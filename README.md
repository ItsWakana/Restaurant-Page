# Restaurant-Page

This restaurant project has really helped to solidify a lot of my DOM manipulation and feeling more comfortable appending and moving different things around dynamically with JS.

I've also developed more of an understanding of webpack and the role it can play to lessen an abundance of excess files and bundle everything together for the end user. I was able to encorporate my stylesheet, JS modules and images into my webpack bundle.

I think if I was to re-do this project I would go down the class/object route to lessen a lot of code reuse for making new items on the menu page.
